# CleverStyle Music
HTML5 application based purely on Web technologies.

Application intended to be used in Firefox OS (should also work in Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android if Firefox browser installed).

There are some interesting technologies used here, like [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) (Web Components) and [Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js) (music playing and decoding of metadata from files)

To play music right now run these commands in console:
```javascript
cs.music_library.rescan()
play()
```

There is almost nothing to see here right now, but, hopefully, soon it will become something useful:)

Feel free to share some ideas for future application in issues, fork and contribute!
